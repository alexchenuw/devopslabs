## Lab 21. Install a k8s cluster with 3 nodes
___
> ### Provision the VM environment by creating 3 VMs

1. Create 3 vm instances as describle in [lab 1](https://github.com/alexchenuw/devopslabs/tree/main/Lab-1)
use k8smaster-netid as the VM names, follow the format like k8smaster-chenalex, k8snode1-chenalex and k8snode2-chenalex
> Note: Once you create the first image, click on this instance to display the details and consider using the "Create Similar" function to duplicate your instance two more times.

2. Install docker engine on all three instances as describle in lab 2

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
```
2.1 Change docker cgroup driver to systemD by creating a file as /etc/docker/daemon.json with the following content
```bash
sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
```bash
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}
```
2.2 restart system service and docker by
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
2.3 verify docker cgroup driver is now systemd
```bash
sudo docker system info |grep -i driver

WARNING: No swap limit support
Storage Driver: overlay2
Logging Driver: json-file
Cgroup Driver: systemd
```
3. Make the system run docker automatically after reboot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

> ### Install k8s components to all three instances
4. add the sign key

 ```bash
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add
```

5. Add the repository and update the repository list again

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"
sudo apt-get update -y
```

6. now install k8s components:

```bash
sudo apt-get install kubeadm kubelet kubectl -y
```

7. turn swap off (k8s won't start with swap on).  Use `free -h` to confirm swap is disabled or turned off.

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
free -h
```

8. set hostnames on three instances according to their roles

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8smaster-chenalex
```

or

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname k8snode1-chenalex
```

9. find the ip address of the three VMs on the console and edit /etc/hosts file on three instances and add three lines

```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

```bash
10.1xx.0.4    k8smaster-chenalex
10.1xx.0.5    k8snode1-chenalex
10.1xx.0.7    k8snode2-chenalex
```

> ### Now run step 10-14 on the master node (and master node ONLY):
10. Initial the cluster setup by running

```bash
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 | tee kube-init.out
```

11. copy the last log showing something like "kubeadm join 10.168.0.4..." to the end of the message, we will use this message later.  

12. create the k8s kubectl directory

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

13. deploy the flannel network pod

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

14. show all the running system pod

```
kubectl get pod --all-namespaces
```
> ### now run step 15 on each of the two node VMs (and ONLY on node VMs) 

15. paste in the message copied earlier from step 11:
```
sudo kubeadm join 10.168.0.4:6443 --token v7ylqj --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:3f5b65334.cde43
```
> ### the cluster has been installed, go back to the master node to run kubectl to check the status:
16. Get back to the master node, show the cluster

```bash
kubectl get node
```
<optional>
17. set the kubectl on your workstation VM to point to the cluster created here
    ## Still remember how to do this? refer to lab 9, last two steps
_hint, you may need to reset the permission of the admin.conf file on the master so that you can copy that file to your VM)_
