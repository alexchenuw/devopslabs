## Lab 19. Create a deployment and expose its service using NodePort
___

_With Lab 19, we will be creating a deployment and then expose the deployment as a service for external users as NodePort, this will be a very typical application deployment scenario_
_we will also experience how a replicaset plays its role to maintain a desired number of pods_

_Notice to students:  by the time this lab begins the our small K8s environment is starting to run low on resources.  Make sure you delete your old pods and services to free up space for these deployments that are launching multiple pods._


> create a deployment file called `lab19_deployment.yaml` replace ${USER} with your userID

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${USER}webdemo
  labels:
    app: webnginx
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginxwebpod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginxwebpod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.18.0
      - name: redis
        image: redis
```

* create the deployment adn check how many pods have been created by the deployment

```bash
kubectl create -f lab19_deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployment ${USER}webdemo
```

* show the replicaset 

```bash
kubectl get replicaset 
kubectl describe replicaset ${USER}webdemo
```
* show the pods created by this deployment

```bash
kubectl get pod -l app=nginxwebpod
```
* try to manually delete the pods, you should be able to see another set of pods created to meet replicas=4

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l app=nginxwebpod
```

> Expose the deployment to an external service using NodePort

* create a service file called 'lab19_service.yaml` that expose the deployment to external using NodePort

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Service 
metadata: 
    name: lab19external 
spec: 
   selector: 
     app: nginxwebpod 
   type: NodePort
   ports: 
        - protocol: TCP 
          port: 80 
          targetPort: 80
```

* create the service and list the service

```bash
kubectl create -f lab19_service.yaml
kubectl get svc lab19external
```

* find the external port number and try to access the service from your laptop

> ## You can combine yaml files using a "---"  We can define the deployment and the service in the same file.  Create a new file called `lab19_combined.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: achenwebdemo
  labels:
    app: webnginx
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginxwebpod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginxwebpod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.18.0
      - name: redis
        image: redis
        
---
apiVersion: v1 
kind: Service 
metadata: 
    name: lab19external 
spec: 
   selector: 
     app: nginxwebpod 
   type: NodePort
   ports: 
        - protocol: TCP 
          port: 80 
          targetPort: 80
```

* delete the earlier deployment and service first

```bash
kubectl delete -f lab19_service.yaml
kubectl delete -f lab19_deployment.yaml
```
* now run create the deployment and service together

```bash
kubectl create -f lab19_combined.yaml
```
* verify the deployment and service
