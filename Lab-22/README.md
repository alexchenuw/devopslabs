## Lab 22. Deploy an application to the k8s cluster
___

> Step 1, deploy the application to your cluster

* Follow the instruction from Lab 19 to deploy an application to your k8s cluster you just built. remember the AlienInvasion game application you build and published to your dockerhub repository, that is the image this lab will use as the application

one tip:

```
replace the container image with the one you created and uploaded to Dockerhub. an example will be:

image: alexchen2015/alex001:mypersonalnginx

```
> Step 2, scale the application to larger capacity

* follow what you did in Lab 19 to scale the application, expose it as an external facing app and play the game from your browser on your laptop.
